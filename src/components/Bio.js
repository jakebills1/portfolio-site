      Jake began playing bass as a young teenager, inspired by classic heavy metal bassists such as Geezer Butler, Steve Harris, and Cliff Burton. He was enrolled in private lessons soon after and began to learn the fundamentals of music theory, aural skills, and was exposed to a variety of different music. It was around this time that he joined his first band and played his first few gigs.
      Jake joined the School of Rock, a nationally-franchised youth music program, at 14. Working with a few different private teachers, he expanded his breadth of musical knowledge and performance experience. During his time at School of Rock he was chosen to perform on the All-star tour, an audition-only group of the best students in the region, two years in a row. In late high school two bands he played bass for, VIA and Squash, were included in the National Association of Music Merchandisers battle of the bands in Anaheim, California. Squash finished in third place and Jake received the Best Bassist award.
      Jake attended the University of Utah and received a Bachelorâ€™s of Music with an emphasis in Jazz Performance, and was privately instructed by Dr. Denson Angulo. During his time there he began studying the upright bass and transcribed the work of famous jazz bassists such as Charles Mingus, Esperanza Spalding, Niels-Henning Orsted Pederson, Steve Swallow, and Paul Chambers. He was in a jazz combo that performed at the Jamey Aebersold Jazz Festival at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, and was in the Jazz Octet, which went on a promotional tour of the Bay area.
      Since graduating in 2015, Jake has entered the world of freelance performance. He has played extensively in Utah, and in Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Arizona, and California at high-profile weddings, private events, and festivals. He performs mainly with the Diamond Empire Band(make this a link), a versatile working band, and Millenial Beat(link), a high-energy party band. Jake has also collaborated with the original bands The Anchorage and Uvluv, on local shows and recordings. He is principal bass with the Wasatch Community Orchestra.
      When not performing, Jake likes cooking, reading, hiking, and mountain biking.
